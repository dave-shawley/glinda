class ServiceLayer(object):
    """
    Represents any number of HTTP services.

    Create an instance of this class to represent any number of HTTP
    services that your application depends on.  It attaches to the
    :class:`~tornado.ioloop.IOLoop` instance that the standard
    :class:`~tornado.testing.AsyncTestCase` supplies and manages
    the Tornado machinery necessary to glue :class:`Service` instances
    to the ioloop.  Each external service that you need to test with
    is represented by a named :class:`Service` instance.  The
    :class:`Service` instance maintains the list of programmed responses.
    The :class:`ServiceLayer` exists to make sure that the requests get to
    the appropriate handler.

    Each managed service is exposed as named :class:`.Service` instance
    that is owned by the :class:`ServiceLayer` instance.  They are created
    on-demand by calling :meth:`.get_service` with the name that you
    assign to them.  The :class:`ServiceLayer` instance implements the same
    behavior as item lookup as well (e.g., ``__getitem__``)::

        >>> from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
        >>> services = ServiceLayer(IOLoop.instance())
        >>> services['service-name'] is services.get_service('service-name')
        True

    Once you have a named service instance, you can configure it to
    respond by calling :meth:`Service.add_response` method.

        >>> from tornado import httpclient, ioloop
        >>> iol = ioloop.IOLoop.instance()
        >>> services = ServiceLayer(iol)
        >>> service = services.get_service('endpoint')
        >>> service.add_response(Request('GET', '/endpoint'),
        ...                      Response(222))
        >>> def get():
        ...    client = httpclient.AsyncHTTPClient(io_loop=iol)
        ...    return client.fetch(service.url_for('endpoint'))
        >>> rsp = iol.run_sync(get)
        >>> rsp.code
        222

    Note that the ``get`` function in the example mimics the application
    under test asynchronously interacting with a service within the
    service layer.
